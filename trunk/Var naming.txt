Camelcase will be used to separate variable names from identifiers or to separate words within variable names.

Every variable will start with one or many one letter identifiers (as it applies) meaning the variable type.
Identifiers will be inserted in the order they appear on this list making a member pointer to an integer "mpiVariable".
Identifiers within the same group will not coexist in a variable name, so even though a handle is always a pointer, both identifiers wont be in the variable name.
